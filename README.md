# Calculator

https://notacallforhelp.github.io/Calculator/

This is a calculator made using mostly Javascript along with html and css.

The interesting part about this project is that this was not made using the eval function in JS.
I manually hardcoded all the parsing and interpretation of all the calculations.

It supports +,-,/,* and also sign change through (+/-).
It also supports floating point arithmetic upto 2 floating point precision.
It also supports keyboard input.

Users can use AC to clear everything or C as a simple backspace.

For firefox users using the '/' key for divison might open quick find, so just disable it by following the instructions here:
